# seo-duplicationThis app is intended for python3 use only.### InstallationClone this repo using the command`$ git clone https://github.com/Falinor/seo-cartographer.git`or download a ZIP archive and unzip it.Because this project is a student project, it is not referenced in thepip registry. In order to install the module locally, go to yourinstallation folder and run:`$ pip install .`The module itself is named *cartodup*. Assuming you are still in theinstallation folder, you may run `$ mkdir test && cd test` to create adirectory where you will run the app.### Running the applicationThe main goal of the application is to compare pages 2 by 2, displayingtheir similarity ratio at the end of the process. The `--file` optionallows one to pass a text file containing URLs to fetch data from.A sample file is present in `resources/pages.txt`. To test the app, youmay run the following:`$ cartodup -f <REPO_ROOT>/resources/pages.txt`This command will run the module and output a CSV file containingresults. You can add any number of resource URLs you want.### TestingTo test the application, you may run the following:`$ python3 setup.py test`This command will run the tests contained in the `tests/` folder.### DocumentationYou can find additional documentation in `docs/build/html/`.This is the generated API documentation.### AuthorAndrea GueugnautEPITA - MTI 2017
